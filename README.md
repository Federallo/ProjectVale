First project of an AI neural network made by me.

## Introduction to Neural Network

A Neural Network is a computational model based on structure and functions of biological neural networks. 
There are three different layers:

-### Input Layer
 Reads all the inputs which are transferred to hidden layers.
 Communicates with the external enviroment that gives information to the neural network. 
 It represents the condition to train the neural network.
-Hidden Layer
 They can be more than one and they are used for processing inputs received from input layers.
-Output Layer
 Stores the data processed from hidden layers.
